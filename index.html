    <h1>Etch a Sketch</h1>
    <p>Create your canvas for creativity! Click the button below to generate a whiteboard. 
        You'll be prompted to specify the size of the canvas; the higher the number, the more pixels your 
        canvas will have, allowing for more precise drawings. As you move your mouse over the squares, 
        they'll be randomly colored, and their opacity will increase with each pass. Enjoy!</p>
